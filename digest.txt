2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter

## Runtime Scene Slices

Plan B from the AI-runtime discussion is now wired into the dev server. When a script jumps to `runtime/...` (for example `changeScene:runtime/ai-demo/entry.txt;`) the asset loader issues a request to `/games/<slug>/scene/runtime/ai-demo/entry.txt`.

### How it works

1. `packages/server/index.js` intercepts every `/games/:slug/scene/runtime/*.txt` request before the static middleware.
2. The request is passed to `packages/server/runtimeSceneProvider.js`.
3. `runtimeSceneProvider` either:
   - Delegates to a custom provider exported from the file pointed to `WEBGAL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER`, or
   - Falls back to the built-in demo slices that showcase a simple choose → branch → end flow.
4. The returned text is served as a regular WebGAL script, so the engine can keep parsing without any extra changes.

### Customising the provider

- Copy `packages/server/runtimeSceneProvider.js` somewhere else, implement your own `getRuntimeSlice(gameSlug, sliceId)` and export it via `module.exports`.
- Start the dev server with `WEBGAL_RUNTIME_PROVIDER=relative/path/to/custom-provider.js yarn workspace WebGAL-Server start`.
- The provider receives:
  - `gameSlug`: folder name under `public/games`.
  - `sliceId`: string such as `ai-demo/entry` (without `.txt`).
- Return plain WebGAL script text. You can call an LLM here, stream files, or query your backend.

### Front-end details

- `packages/webgal/src/Core/util/prefetcher/scenePrefetcher.ts` skips any scene containing `/runtime/` to avoid prefetch errors.
- The sample game (`games/story-lab`) adds a third option in `scene/start.txt` that calls `runtime/ai-demo/entry.txt`, which hits the demo provider so you can see the flow end-to-end.

Once your generator is ready, simply emit more slices via `changeScene: runtime/...;` or branch with `choose:` entries that point to other runtime slices. The engine still handles saves/loads as usual because the runtime slices live in the same scene pipeline.

FILE: dev-docs/动画与变换系统设计.md
================================================
## 动画系统设计

在 WebGAL 新版本中，`动画`将会是一个 `PIXI.Ticker` 回调函数。而`变换`则是一个特殊的动画，只不过执行时间是0ms（在动画的第一帧就将舞台对象设置为终态状态）。

除此以外，因为并不是每一个舞台状态都包含动画相关的演出，所以为了在动画结束后也要保持舞台对象处于动画结束后被设置的位置（或应用的效果），还会有一个“内部变换”。

“内部变换”是一连串对指定 key 的舞台对象要应用的效果的记录。“内部变换”调用的时机一般是任何舞台对象动画结束后或舞台对象发生改变时。

为了防止“内部变换”影响舞台对象上动画的正常运行，WebGAL 舞台控制器有一个记录，可以记录下正在进行动画的舞台对象的 key，这些key会被锁定，无法应用变换。直到动画结束后，才会被解锁。

在任何动画结束后，动画执行程序都会将其作用的舞台对象的“终态”更新到对应的 key 的舞台对象的“内部变换”记录上。

## 不同类型的动画

在 WebGAL 中，可以作用在舞台对象上的动画，可以分为即时动画和退出动画。

即时动画会在脚本被调用的时候被立即触发。由于在没有任何动画被设置的情况下，舞台对象会预设一个渐入，所以如果想要自定义渐入动画，只需要在切换立绘/背景后立刻执行一个自定义的即时动画就可以了。

而退出动画将会在立绘/背景被移除时作用。默认的退出动画是一个渐出。如果想要应用一个退出动画，一个比较好的方式是在立绘退出时（在切换或关闭立绘时）为带有后缀 `-off` 的退出舞台对象设置一个即时动画。

所以，无论是进入还是退出动画，都应在 setFigure 或 setBg 后应用，无论这个命令是为了添加还是删除一个立绘。

FILE: dev-docs/演出调用说明.md
================================================
## 演出调用说明

第一步，语句调用器 `runScript.ts` 根据语句类型执行一个语句，语句会返回一个IPerform对象，并将当前语句的演出写入到场景状态。

```typescript
/**
 * 描述演出的接口，主要用于控制演出，而不是执行（在演出开始时被调用演出的执行器返回）
 * @interface IPerform
 */
export interface IPerform {
  // 演出名称，用于在后面手动清除演出，如果没有标识，则代表不是保持演出，给予一个随机字符串
  performName: string;
  // 持续时间，单位为ms，持续时间到后自动回收演出
  duration: number;
  // 演出是不是一个保持类型的演出
  isHoldOn: boolean;
  // 卸载演出的函数
  stopFunction: () => void;
  // 演出是否阻塞游戏流程继续（一个函数，返回 boolean类型的结果，判断要不要阻塞）
  blockingNext: () => boolean;
  // 演出是否阻塞自动模式（一个函数，返回 boolean类型的结果，判断要不要阻塞）
  blockingAuto: () => boolean;
  // 自动回收使用的 Timeout，一般在调用演出的函数里不设置，演出管理器获取到 IPerofrm 后会根据 duration 自动设置
  stopTimeout: undefined | ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>;
  // 演出结束后转到下一句
  goNextWhenOver?: boolean;
  // 对于延迟触发的演出，使用 Promise
  arrangePerformPromise?: Promise<IPerform>;
  // 跳过由 nextSentence 函数引发的演出回收
  skipNextCollect?: boolean;
}
```

第二步，语句调用器 `runScript.ts` 会设定一个自动的计时器，用于结束并卸载对象。

第三步，在演出时间抵达时，卸载演出（语句调用器会在指定时间自动卸载），直到演出列表里没有演出（保持演出则不会卸载）

**注意：`isOver` 为 `true` 时，不会阻塞auto和next，这时候不检查 `blockingNext` 与 `blockingAuto`**

当在演出时发生auto调用： auto函数会检查演出列表，如果只存在不阻塞auto的演出，就调用auto。

当在演出时发生next调用： next函数会结束所有可打断演出，卸载演出。 卸载所有非 `HoldOn` 计时器 如果存在阻塞next的演出，next不会响应。

当在自动播放（auto）模式下触发next（用户点击鼠标）

1.检查是否存在阻塞next的演出，否则不响应

2.如果没有被阻塞，那么就停止所有演出，并停止auto
