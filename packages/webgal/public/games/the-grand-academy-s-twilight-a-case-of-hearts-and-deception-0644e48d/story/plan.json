However, the Academy's veneer of excellence quickly cracks, revealing a sprawling conspiracy. Your objective is to uncover the truth behind this campus-wide deception. Yet, with every step towards exposing the Academy's secrets, the shadow of your own past looms larger, threatening to unravel your carefully constructed facade. Your choices will determine not only the fate of the Academy but also the price you pay for the truth and whether your heart finds solace or further deception.",
