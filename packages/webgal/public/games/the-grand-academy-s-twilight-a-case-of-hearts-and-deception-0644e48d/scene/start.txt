intro:The carriage wheels grind on ancient cobblestones|A cold mist clings to the Grand Academy's spires|My past, a phantom limb, aches with every beat of my new heart;
:The wrought iron gates loom, adorned with a crest I don't recognize;
:A shiver traces my spine, a premonition of secrets yet to unfold;
:My hand tightens on the satchel, its contents a silent promise and a heavy burden;
:The air here smells of old parchment and something metallic, faintly unsettling;
:A cloaked figure watches from a shadowed archway, then vanishes;
:I step onto the manicured grounds, the silence echoing my apprehension;
